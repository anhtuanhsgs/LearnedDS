# A Learned Data Structure project

## Installation
I tested my code with ```CUDA 10.0```, ```pytorch 1.1.0```, ```gym 0.14.0```, ```Ubuntu 18.04```

## Training
For training, at least one GPU is required. In case memory is not enough, try reduce the number of workers in ```train.sh```
```
bash train.sh
```

## Inference / Testing
```
